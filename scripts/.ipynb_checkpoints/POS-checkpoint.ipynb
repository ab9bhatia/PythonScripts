       "'The concept for Super Mario Galaxy s gameplay originated from ideas taken from Super Mario      a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in      to exemplify the processing power of the GameCube          The demonstration s director  and future director of Super Mario Galaxy   Yoshiaki Koizumi  desired that one of its distinguishing features  spherical based platforms  should be used in a future game  but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons      Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late               pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised      A prototype of the game s physics system took three months to build  where it was decided that the game s use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment  with the concept of gravity as a major feature      During development  the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto  where he would make suggestions to the game design      According to Koizumi  many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun       The idea for Mario to have a  spin  attack came during the early stages of development      when it was decided that jumping on enemies on a spherical map would be difficult for some players     at one point  Koizumi remarked that making characters jump in a  D environment was  absurd       Takeo Shimizu  the game s producer and programmer  noted that the most basic action in a  D action game was to simply run  and concluded that the easiest way to attack was to  spin   not jump  Prior to the development team shifting focus on the Wii and realising the potential of its different controls  the  spin  attack was originally planned to be executed by swivelling the analogue stick on the GameCube controller      The  spin  was initially activated via rotation of the Nunchuk s control stick  but after motion sensing was confirmed to be implemented in the Wii Remote  the  spin  was changed to be activated through shaking the latter  Nintendo president Satoru Iwata wanted to prioritise the game s  fun factor  by giving the player a sense of achievement after they have completed a difficult task  Iwata noted an increasing number of consumers giving up during a video game and thus wanted Super Mario Galaxy to appeal to that audience  In response  the development team created a co operative mode which allowed one player to control Mario whilst the other controlled the pointer with the Wii Remote  therefore enabling lesser experienced players to enjoy themselves in the game       The development team wanted the game to be enjoyed from the ages of    to      so during early stages of development they took steps to ensure that the player would adjust to the game without difficulty  However  Miyamoto thought that it was too easy and lacked insensitivity  asserting that a game loses its excitement when it is made unchallenging      To balance out the difficulty  Koizumi suggested that Mario s health meter should have a maximum capacity of three instead of eight  but at the same time more   Up Mushrooms and checkpoints would be placed in the game  Koizumi said that he wanted to alter the game s  intensity factor  by limiting the number of hits the player could take to three  as opposed to Super Mario    and Super Mario Sunshine  which featured eight  Retrospectively  Iwata added that decreasing the health meter to three from eight is  representative of the things that players do not notice that actually changes the gameplay dramatically        With the concept of gravity and spherical platforms being the central elements of gameplay  the development team drafted several ideas on how to implement them into the game     Koichi Hayashida  a co designer of the game  initially expressed scepticism of incorporating a spherical playing field into a jump based platform game  stating that it would be  a bad match   Shimizu also had a negative reaction to the idea  with his main concern being that the implementation of spherical platforms would be impossible to achieve due to technical reasons  and  felt a sense of danger  when the plan was eventually approved  However  once Shimizu started debugging the game he realised that the experience felt  totally fresh  and thought that he was  playing a game like nothing that s come before it      Futoshi Shirai  the game s level designer  stated that unlike Hayashida and Shimizu  he had a positive impression of the new gameplay elements  Shirai liked the idea of being able to run on different types of planetoids  and came up with designs such as planets in the shape of ice cream and apples     Due to the game being set in outer space  the team could devise a lot of ideas that would have otherwise been hard to implement in other Super Mario games  Shirai said that the benefit of working with a spherical shaped world was that they could design and discover new things  with Kenta Motokura  the game s artist  similarly stating that the player would be continuously enjoying their adventure by travelling to new planets     Koizumi appreciated the  free and open  feel of developing the game  saying that it enabled the team to make the game more fun for the player       Throughout development  staff members enjoyed the level of freedom the game offered  in particular the transforming abilities of Mario      Iwata noted that Mario s Bee Suit was popular with women  and also stated that the titular character s other suits were designed to add variations to the gameplay  According to Hayashida  the idea to include transformations in the game came from Koizumi  One of the female members of staff who worked on Super Mario Galaxy wrote a note saying  I want a Bee Mario  when asked by Koizumi what they wanted to transform Mario into  Shirai stated that the development team always discussed their ideas together  and devised ways to incorporate an idea into the game and make it more entertaining  Iwata concluded that having the game take place in space was advantageous  as it was flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of ideas        After development was finished  the team reflected that the fundamental part of a Super Mario game was to make the player think about how  fun  it was to play the game itself  rather than simply finishing it      To accomplish this  Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people  including children  Shimizu added that Super Mario Galaxy s ulterior motive was to have everybody  gather around the TV   as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone  The game was made to support six different save files     Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own      Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released  there used to be  many more  people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience  Iwata asserted that well made video games were more enjoyable to spectate  and hoped that Super Mario Galaxy s co operative mode would tempt someone who does not usually play video games to join  During development  Mahito Yokota  who was in charge of the musical direction  originally wanted Super Mario Galaxy to have a Latin American style of music  and even had composed    tracks in that style      Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous Super Mario instalments  such as steelpans  bongo drums  and congas      For Super Mario Galaxy s theme  Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films  The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi  the game s director and designer  but when Yokota presented it to the game s sound supervisor  Koji Kondo      he stated that it was  no good       When asked why his music was rejected  Kondo responded   if somewhere in your mind you have an image that Mario is cute  please get rid of it   Incensed by the rejection  Yokota almost resigned from his job  but Kondo implied that Mario s character was  cool  and instructed him to try again       According to Yokota  he was under the impression that Mario was suited for children  causing him to create  cute  music that would appeal to the targeted audience      Three months later  Yokota presented three different styles of music to Miyamoto  one piece had an orchestral sound  the other had pop music  and the last featured a mix of both orchestral and pop music      Miyamoto chose the orchestral piece  as it sounded the most  space like   Yotaka stated that Miyamoto chose the piece without knowing that Kondo actually wrote it          In a retrospective interview  Satoru Iwata said that Miyamoto chose the music that sounded  space like  because he was looking for a sound that would express the game  in contrast to the tropical sounds of Super Mario Bros  Yotaka revealed that he initially struggled to create music that sounded like a Super Mario game  but as time progressed he declared that the songs he made for the game had  become natural        To create a sense of variety with the soundtrack  Yokota and Kondo wrote pieces individually  Kondo composed four pieces for the game whereas Yokota composed the rest  Kondo composed the pieces that Yokata specifically requested  as he thought that the game s soundtrack would  end up all sounding the same  if it were composed by one person      The game originally heavily utilised the Wii Remote speaker for  all sorts of sound  effects    but Masafumi Kawamura  the game s sound director  decided they were redundant when played in tandem with those from the television  Kawamura decided to restrict Wii Remote sound effects to those triggered by Mario s actions  such as hitting an enemy  feeling that it better immersed the player       The game s soundtrack features    orchestral songs performed by a    person symphony orchestra          Yokota initially had concerns whether or not orchestral music would fit in with the rhythm of a Mario game  but thought that such music would make the scale of the game  seem more epic   Kondo  on the other hand  believed if orchestral music were used the player would be  obligated to play the game in time to the music       To synchronise the soundtrack to gameplay  Kawamura utilised similar techniques he used to synchronise sound effects in The Legend of Zelda  Wind Waker and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat     in which the game synchronises MIDI data with streaming data  resulting in sound effects playing at the same time as background music  To make synchronisation possible  the audio team requested the orchestra to perform at different tempos set with a metronome       The official soundtrack was released on    January       It was initially an exclusive to Club Nintendo subscribers in Japan      although the soundtrack became available to European Club Nintendo members in November           The soundtrack was released in two versions  the Original Soundtrack  which only contains    tracks from the game  and the Platinum Edition  which contains another    tracks on a second disc for a total of    tracks       BAFTA      GameSpot      IGN      Nintendo Power      Kotaku      Yahoo  Games     Game of the Year The game received critical acclaim and was a commercial success upon release  becoming the sixth highest rated game of all time on review aggregator Metacritic      having an aggregate score of    out of     based on    reviews      It is the second highest rated game of all time on GameRankings      having a        ranking based on    reviews  By the end of March       Nintendo had sold       million copies of the game worldwide  making it the third best selling non bundled Wii game and the ninth best selling Nintendo published game for the Wii       The visuals and presentation were the most praised aspects of the game  Chris Scullion of the Official Nintendo Magazine asserted that the graphics pushes the Wii to its full potential  and stated that its visual effects and large playing areas would constantly astound the player      Jeremy Parish from  UP com noted that despite the Wii s limitations  the visuals were  absolutely impressive   especially when modified at a higher resolution      Computer and Video Games s Andrew Robinson opined that Nintendo favoured gameplay over graphics  but thought Super Mario Galaxy  got both perfect       Margaret Robertson of Eurogamer called the visuals an  explosion of inventiveness   stating that the game s detail is only matched by its mission design ingenuity      Andrew Reiner of Game Informer approved of the game s portrayal of water and particle effects  but noted the visuals were in similar detail to Super Mario Sunshine      Patrick Shaw from GamePro opined that the game takes full advantage of the Wii s capabilities  both in terms of presentation and control schemes       Regarding the presentation  Game Revolution s Chris Hudak thought that Super Mario Galaxy was a  next gen reincarnation  of Super Mario     stating the game was polished  engaging and evocative      Alex Navarro of GameSpot commended the colourful and vibrant level details  animations and character designs  saying that  there simply isn t a better looking Wii game available   Furthermore  Navarro praised the game engine s ability of keeping frame rate drops to  infrequent bouts       Bryn Williams of GameSpy asserted that the game had the best visuals on the Wii  saying that the graphics  are out of this world  and that its wide range of colours produces  better than expected  texturing      A reviewer from GamesRadar stated that  words simply can t describe  the game s visual concepts      Louis Bedigan from GameZone thought the visualisations from Super Mario Galaxy contrast from the blocky characters of previous Super Mario games  praising the planet designs as beautiful and everything else as  pure eye candy       Matt Casamassina of IGN thought Super Mario Galaxy was the only game that pushed the Wii console  stating it combines  great art  with  great tech   resulting in what he described to be  stunning results      David Halverson of Play opined that the game was  supremely  polished and featured  gorgeous next gen  graphics       The gameplay  in particular the gravity mechanics and use of the Wii Remote  was also praised  A reviewer from Famitsu commented on the game s tempo  believing it was  abnormally good  and that the different variations in level design and difficulty gradually  builds things up       A reviewer from Edge praised the game s use of the Wii Remote  stating the control schemes were more subtle and persuasive as opposed to the  vigorous literalism  of The Legend of Zelda  Twilight Princess      Scullion was initially sceptical about using the Wii Remote as a pointer  but admitted that  within mere minutes it felt like we d been doing this since the days of Mario      Scullion also thought that the game s strongest aspect was the  incomparable  gameplay      Parish praised the fluctuating gravity that was featured in the game  stating that it  makes even the wildest challenge feel almost second nature       Robinson similarly commended the gravity  saying that the different uses of the game s gravitational pulls allows the scale of to grow to  genuinely draw dropping proportions       Robertson regarded the use of gravity as an  explosion of inventiveness       Reiner thought that the game reinvented the platform genre for the seventh generation of video game consoles  stating that Super Mario Galaxy was both nostalgic and new by breaking the laws of physics       Shaw asserted that the new gameplay mechanics reinvigorated the Super Mario franchise  and summarised by saying it was the best title since Super Mario         Similarly  Hudak thought that the game was a reincarnation of Super Mario     whilst stating that the variety of gameplay had a  signature Miyamoto style       Navarro said that the level designs were  top flight in every regard  and also praised the game s introduction of suits  adding that they brought a  great dimension  to gameplay      Williams opined that the game s  shallow  two player mode did not add anything to the overall experience  He did praise the various gameplay components and the use of both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck  stating that the setup was  pinpoint accurate       A reviewer from GamesRadar thought that the control scheme had a fluid response that improved over the controls of its predecessor  Super Mario Sunshine      Regarding the controls and world designs  Bedigan stated that both aspects are  close to perfection as a game can get       Casamassina found the gameplay mechanics  in particular varying physics  as  ridiculously entertaining   He also regarded the motion control as being well implemented  stating that the player would appreciate the change of pace that the levels offer     Halverson particularly commended the innovative controls  saying the Wii Remote and Nunchuck was  at its finest  and that it was difficult to imagine playing it in another fashion       The soundtrack and audio were well received by critics  Scullion believed it to be the best out of any Super Mario game  declaring that each track matches the environments featured throughout the game      Parish considered the orchestrated music superior to the visuals  saying that the dynamic sounds were  quintessentially Mario  yet uncharacteristically sophisticated      Reiner stated that the orchestrated soundtrack was beautiful as well as nostalgic      with Robinson similarly citing it as  amazing       Navarro praised the modernised orchestrated soundtrack  stating that it was both excellent and  top notch       Williams thought the game featured the best sound on the Wii  stating that original soundtrack would  go down in history  as Nintendo s best first party effort      A reviewer from GamesRadar stated that Super Mario Galaxy featured the finest orchestral bombast ever heard in a game      Bedigan asserted that the soundtrack was  another step forward  in video game music  praising the music as moving and breathtaking      Casamassina judged the game s music  so exceptional  and  absolutely superb   summarising that it had the best music out of any Nintendo game to date     Hudak criticised the  traditional Mario esque  lack of voice acting  despite admitting that if the game did feature voice acting it would  probably seem lame and wrong        Awards edit  Super Mario Galaxy received Game of the Year      awards from IGN      GameSpot      Nintendo Power      Kotaku      and Yahoo  Games      The game was also perceived as the highest ranking title in      according to the review aggregator GameRankings      In February       the game received the  Adventure Game of the Year  award

       "'The concept for Super Mario Galaxy\\'s gameplay originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing power of the GameCube.[28][29] The demonstration\\'s director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired that one of its distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons.[30] Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004,[30][31] pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised.[30] A prototype of the game\\'s physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game\\'s use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature.[30] During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design.[30] According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.[29]\\n\\nThe idea for Mario to have a \"spin\" attack came during the early stages of development,[29] when it was decided that jumping on enemies on a spherical map would be difficult for some players â€“ at one point, Koizumi remarked that making characters jump in a 3D environment was \"absurd\".[15] Takeo Shimizu, the game\\'s producer and programmer, noted that the most basic action in a 3D action game was to simply run, and concluded that the easiest way to attack was to \"spin\", not jump. Prior to the development team shifting focus on the Wii and realising the potential of its different controls, the \"spin\" attack was originally planned to be executed by swivelling the analogue stick on the GameCube controller.[29] The \"spin\" was initially activated via rotation of the Nunchuk\\'s control stick, but after motion sensing was confirmed to be implemented in the Wii Remote, the \"spin\" was changed to be activated through shaking the latter. Nintendo president Satoru Iwata wanted to prioritise the game\\'s \"fun factor\" by giving the player a sense of achievement after they have completed a difficult task; Iwata noted an increasing number of consumers giving up during a video game and thus wanted Super Mario Galaxy to appeal to that audience. In response, the development team created a co-operative mode which allowed one player to control Mario whilst the other controlled the pointer with the Wii Remote, therefore enabling lesser experienced players to enjoy themselves in the game.[15]\\n\\nThe development team wanted the game to be enjoyed from the ages of \"5 to 95\", so during early stages of development they took steps to ensure that the player would adjust to the game without difficulty. However, Miyamoto thought that it was too easy and lacked insensitivity, asserting that a game loses its excitement when it is made unchallenging.[22] To balance out the difficulty, Koizumi suggested that Mario\\'s health meter should have a maximum capacity of three instead of eight, but at the same time more 1-Up Mushrooms and checkpoints would be placed in the game. Koizumi said that he wanted to alter the game\\'s \"intensity factor\" by limiting the number of hits the player could take to three, as opposed to Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine, which featured eight. Retrospectively, Iwata added that decreasing the health meter to three from eight is \"representative of the things that players do not notice that actually changes the gameplay dramatically\".[22]\\n\\nWith the concept of gravity and spherical platforms being the central elements of gameplay, the development team drafted several ideas on how to implement them into the game.[7] Koichi Hayashida, a co-designer of the game, initially expressed scepticism of incorporating a spherical playing field into a jump-based platform game, stating that it would be \"a bad match\". Shimizu also had a negative reaction to the idea, with his main concern being that the implementation of spherical platforms would be impossible to achieve due to technical reasons, and \"felt a sense of danger\" when the plan was eventually approved. However, once Shimizu started debugging the game he realised that the experience felt \"totally fresh\" and thought that he was \"playing a game like nothing that\\'s come before it\".[7] Futoshi Shirai, the game\\'s level designer, stated that unlike Hayashida and Shimizu, he had a positive impression of the new gameplay elements. Shirai liked the idea of being able to run on different types of planetoids, and came up with designs such as planets in the shape of ice cream and apples.[7] Due to the game being set in outer space, the team could devise a lot of ideas that would have otherwise been hard to implement in other Super Mario games. Shirai said that the benefit of working with a spherical-shaped world was that they could design and discover new things, with Kenta Motokura, the game\\'s artist, similarly stating that the player would be continuously enjoying their adventure by travelling to new planets.[7] Koizumi appreciated the \"free and open\" feel of developing the game, saying that it enabled the team to make the game more fun for the player.[29]\\n\\nThroughout development, staff members enjoyed the level of freedom the game offered, in particular the transforming abilities of Mario.[32] Iwata noted that Mario\\'s Bee Suit was popular with women, and also stated that the titular character\\'s other suits were designed to add variations to the gameplay. According to Hayashida, the idea to include transformations in the game came from Koizumi. One of the female members of staff who worked on Super Mario Galaxy wrote a note saying \"I want a Bee Mario\" when asked by Koizumi what they wanted to transform Mario into. Shirai stated that the development team always discussed their ideas together, and devised ways to incorporate an idea into the game and make it more entertaining. Iwata concluded that having the game take place in space was advantageous, as it was flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of ideas.[32]\\n\\n\\nAfter development was finished, the team reflected that the fundamental part of a Super Mario game was to make the player think about how \"fun\" it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it.[22] To accomplish this, Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people, including children. Shimizu added that Super Mario Galaxy\\'s ulterior motive was to have everybody \"gather around the TV\", as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone. The game was made to support six different save files â€“ Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own.[22] Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released, there used to be \"many more\" people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience. Iwata asserted that well-made video games were more enjoyable to spectate, and hoped that Super Mario Galaxy\\'s co-operative mode would tempt someone who does not usually play video games to join\\n\\nDuring development, Mahito Yokota, who was in charge of the musical direction, originally wanted Super Mario Galaxy to have a Latin American style of music; and even had composed 28 tracks in that style.[33] Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous Super Mario instalments, such as steelpans, bongo drums, and congas.[34] For Super Mario Galaxy\\'s theme, Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films. The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi, the game\\'s director and designer, but when Yokota presented it to the game\\'s sound supervisor, Koji Kondo,[35] he stated that it was \"no good\".[34] When asked why his music was rejected, Kondo responded: \"if somewhere in your mind you have an image that Mario is cute, please get rid of it\". Incensed by the rejection, Yokota almost resigned from his job, but Kondo implied that Mario\\'s character was \"cool\" and instructed him to try again.[34]\\n\\nAccording to Yokota, he was under the impression that Mario was suited for children, causing him to create \"cute\" music that would appeal to the targeted audience.[34] Three months later, Yokota presented three different styles of music to Miyamoto: one piece had an orchestral sound, the other had pop music, and the last featured a mix of both orchestral and pop music.[36] Miyamoto chose the orchestral piece, as it sounded the most \"space-like\". Yotaka stated that Miyamoto chose the piece without knowing that Kondo actually wrote it.[29][36] In a retrospective interview, Satoru Iwata said that Miyamoto chose the music that sounded \"space-like\" because he was looking for a sound that would express the game, in contrast to the tropical sounds of Super Mario Bros. Yotaka revealed that he initially struggled to create music that sounded like a Super Mario game, but as time progressed he declared that the songs he made for the game had \"become natural\".[36]\\n\\nTo create a sense of variety with the soundtrack, Yokota and Kondo wrote pieces individually; Kondo composed four pieces for the game whereas Yokota composed the rest. Kondo composed the pieces that Yokata specifically requested, as he thought that the game\\'s soundtrack would \"end up all sounding the same\" if it were composed by one person.[36] The game originally heavily utilised the Wii Remote speaker for \"all sorts of sound [effects]\", but Masafumi Kawamura, the game\\'s sound director, decided they were redundant when played in tandem with those from the television. Kawamura decided to restrict Wii Remote sound effects to those triggered by Mario\\'s actions, such as hitting an enemy, feeling that it better immersed the player.[37]\\n\\nThe game\\'s soundtrack features 28 orchestral songs performed by a 50-person symphony orchestra.[35][38] Yokota initially had concerns whether or not orchestral music would fit in with the rhythm of a Mario game, but thought that such music would make the scale of the game \"seem more epic\". Kondo, on the other hand, believed if orchestral music were used the player would be \"obligated to play the game in time to the music\".[33] To synchronise the soundtrack to gameplay, Kawamura utilised similar techniques he used to synchronise sound effects in The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat â€” in which the game synchronises MIDI data with streaming data, resulting in sound effects playing at the same time as background music. To make synchronisation possible, the audio team requested the orchestra to perform at different tempos set with a metronome.[33]\\n\\nThe official soundtrack was released on 24 January 2008. It was initially an exclusive to Club Nintendo subscribers in Japan,[39] although the soundtrack became available to European Club Nintendo members in November 2008.[40] The soundtrack was released in two versions: the Original Soundtrack, which only contains 28 tracks from the game, and the Platinum Edition, which contains another 53 tracks on a second disc for a total of 81 tracks.[40]\\n\\nBAFTA,[56] GameSpot,[57] IGN,[58] Nintendo Power,[59] Kotaku,[60] Yahoo! Games[61]\\tGame of the Year\\nThe game received critical acclaim and was a commercial success upon release, becoming the sixth highest rated game of all-time on review aggregator Metacritic,[62] having an aggregate score of 97 out of 100 based on 73 reviews.[42] It is the second highest-rated game of all time on GameRankings,[63] having a 97.64% ranking based on 78 reviews. By the end of March 2017, Nintendo had sold 12.75 million copies of the game worldwide, making it the third best-selling non-bundled Wii game and the ninth best-selling Nintendo-published game for the Wii.[64]\\n\\nThe visuals and presentation were the most praised aspects of the game. Chris Scullion of the Official Nintendo Magazine asserted that the graphics pushes the Wii to its full potential, and stated that its visual effects and large playing areas would constantly astound the player.[65] Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com noted that despite the Wii\\'s limitations, the visuals were \"absolutely impressive\", especially when modified at a higher resolution.[43] Computer and Video Games\\'s Andrew Robinson opined that Nintendo favoured gameplay over graphics, but thought Super Mario Galaxy \"got both perfect\".[44] Margaret Robertson of Eurogamer called the visuals an \"explosion of inventiveness\", stating that the game\\'s detail is only matched by its mission design ingenuity.[17] Andrew Reiner of Game Informer approved of the game\\'s portrayal of water and particle effects, but noted the visuals were in similar detail to Super Mario Sunshine.[47] Patrick Shaw from GamePro opined that the game takes full advantage of the Wii\\'s capabilities, both in terms of presentation and control schemes.[48]\\n\\nRegarding the presentation, Game Revolution\\'s Chris Hudak thought that Super Mario Galaxy was a \"next-gen reincarnation\" of Super Mario 64, stating the game was polished, engaging and evocative.[49] Alex Navarro of GameSpot commended the colourful and vibrant level details, animations and character designs, saying that \"there simply isn\\'t a better-looking Wii game available\". Furthermore, Navarro praised the game engine\\'s ability of keeping frame rate drops to \"infrequent bouts\".[50] Bryn Williams of GameSpy asserted that the game had the best visuals on the Wii, saying that the graphics \"are out of this world\" and that its wide range of colours produces \"better-than-expected\" texturing.[51] A reviewer from GamesRadar stated that \"words simply can\\'t describe\" the game\\'s visual concepts.[52] Louis Bedigan from GameZone thought the visualisations from Super Mario Galaxy contrast from the blocky characters of previous Super Mario games, praising the planet designs as beautiful and everything else as \"pure eye candy\".[53] Matt Casamassina of IGN thought Super Mario Galaxy was the only game that pushed the Wii console, stating it combines \"great art\" with \"great tech\", resulting in what he described to be \"stunning results\".[3] David Halverson of Play opined that the game was \"supremely\" polished and featured \"gorgeous next-gen\" graphics.[55]\\n\\nThe gameplay, in particular the gravity mechanics and use of the Wii Remote, was also praised. A reviewer from Famitsu commented on the game\\'s tempo, believing it was \"abnormally good\" and that the different variations in level design and difficulty gradually \"builds things up\".[46] A reviewer from Edge praised the game\\'s use of the Wii Remote, stating the control schemes were more subtle and persuasive as opposed to the \"vigorous literalism\" of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.[45] Scullion was initially sceptical about using the Wii Remote as a pointer, but admitted that \"within mere minutes it felt like we\\'d been doing this since the days of Mario 64\". Scullion also thought that the game\\'s strongest aspect was the \"incomparable\" gameplay.[54] Parish praised the fluctuating gravity that was featured in the game, stating that it \"makes even the wildest challenge feel almost second nature\".[43] Robinson similarly commended the gravity, saying that the different uses of the game\\'s gravitational pulls allows the scale of to grow to \"genuinely draw-dropping proportions\".[44] Robertson regarded the use of gravity as an \"explosion of inventiveness\".[17] Reiner thought that the game reinvented the platform genre for the seventh generation of video game consoles, stating that Super Mario Galaxy was both nostalgic and new by breaking the laws of physics.[47]\\n\\nShaw asserted that the new gameplay mechanics reinvigorated the Super Mario franchise, and summarised by saying it was the best title since Super Mario 64.[48] Similarly, Hudak thought that the game was a reincarnation of Super Mario 64, whilst stating that the variety of gameplay had a \"signature Miyamoto style\".[49] Navarro said that the level designs were \"top flight in every regard\" and also praised the game\\'s introduction of suits, adding that they brought a \"great dimension\" to gameplay.[50] Williams opined that the game\\'s \"shallow\" two-player mode did not add anything to the overall experience. He did praise the various gameplay components and the use of both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, stating that the setup was \"pinpoint accurate\".[51] A reviewer from GamesRadar thought that the control scheme had a fluid response that improved over the controls of its predecessor, Super Mario Sunshine.[52] Regarding the controls and world designs, Bedigan stated that both aspects are \"close to perfection as a game can get\".[53] Casamassina found the gameplay mechanics, in particular varying physics, as \"ridiculously entertaining\". He also regarded the motion control as being well implemented, stating that the player would appreciate the change of pace that the levels offer.[3] Halverson particularly commended the innovative controls, saying the Wii Remote and Nunchuck was \"at its finest\" and that it was difficult to imagine playing it in another fashion.[55]\\n\\nThe soundtrack and audio were well received by critics. Scullion believed it to be the best out of any Super Mario game, declaring that each track matches the environments featured throughout the game.[66] Parish considered the orchestrated music superior to the visuals, saying that the dynamic sounds were \"quintessentially Mario\" yet uncharacteristically sophisticated.[43] Reiner stated that the orchestrated soundtrack was beautiful as well as nostalgic,[47] with Robinson similarly citing it as \"amazing\".[44] Navarro praised the modernised orchestrated soundtrack, stating that it was both excellent and \"top-notch\".[50] Williams thought the game featured the best sound on the Wii, stating that original soundtrack would \"go down in history\" as Nintendo\\'s best first-party effort.[51] A reviewer from GamesRadar stated that Super Mario Galaxy featured the finest orchestral bombast ever heard in a game.[52] Bedigan asserted that the soundtrack was \"another step forward\" in video game music, praising the music as moving and breathtaking.[53] Casamassina judged the game\\'s music \"so exceptional\" and \"absolutely superb\", summarising that it had the best music out of any Nintendo game to date.[3] Hudak criticised the \"traditional Mario-esque\" lack of voice acting, despite admitting that if the game did feature voice acting it would \"probably seem lame and wrong\".[49]\\n\\nAwards[edit]\\nSuper Mario Galaxy received Game of the Year 2007 awards from IGN,[58] GameSpot,[57] Nintendo Power,[59] Kotaku,[60] and Yahoo! Games.[61] The game was also perceived as the highest ranking title in 2007 according to the review aggregator GameRankings.[67] In February 2008, the game received the \"Adventure Game of the Year\" award from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences at the Interactive Achievement Awards.[68] Super Mario Galaxy placed third in the Official Nintendo Magazine\\'s \"100 greatest Nintendo games of all time\" list.[69] In 2009, the game won the \"Game of the Year\" BAFTA at the 5th British Academy Games Awards, surpassing Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,[56][70] whilst in the same year, Super Mario Galaxy was named the number one Wii game by IGN.[71] It was also named by Eurogamer and IGN as the \"Game of the Generation\".[72][73] In 2015, the game placed 11th on USgamer\\'s \"15 Best Games Since 2000\" list.[74] Guinness World Records ranked Super Mario Galaxy 29th in their list of top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[75] In their final ever issue, the Official Nintendo Magazine ranked Super Mario Galaxy as the greatest Nintendo game of all time.[76] The soundtrack also won the \"Best Design in Audio\" award from Edge.[77]\\n\\nSequel[edit]\\nMain article: Super Mario Galaxy 2\\nIn the 1,000th issue of Famitsu, Miyamoto expressed his interest in making a sequel to Super Mario Galaxy.[78] The game was originally called \"Super Mario Galaxy More\" during development, and was initially going to feature variations of planets featured in Super Mario Galaxy. Over time, new elements and ideas were brought into the game, and it was decided that the game would be a full sequel.[79]\\n\\nSuper Mario Galaxy 2 was announced during the Nintendo conference at E3 2009 held in Los Angeles.[80][81] It was released on 23 May 2010 in North America, 27 May 2010 in Japan and on 11 June 2010 in Europe.[82] The sequel has been met with as much critical acclaim as its predecessor,[83][84] and has sold 6.36 million copies worldwide as of April 2011.[85]'"
